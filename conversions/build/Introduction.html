<p>Chemicals enable our lives as we know them, from personal care products
to cell phones. However, the use of toxic chemicals create public health
problems including cancers, heart disease, stroke, asthma, reduced
fertility, birth defects, and intellectual disabilities. Poor health
outcomes from exposure to chemicals disproportionately impact vulnerable
populations and economically disadvantaged communities. Chemicals have
benefits and hazards, which must both be considered together
(<a class="reference external" href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.8b00174">1</a>).</p>
<p>Many of the chemicals on the US market have never been fully tested for
safety. Toxic chemicals not only influence human health but have
detrimental effects on animals, plants, and ecosystems. Harmful
chemicals cost the US more than $737 billion (4.4% of GDP) in healthcare
costs and lost earnings
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27765541">2a</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515302494">2b</a>).</p>
<p>There are also significant negative impacts from waste: costs for
wastewater treatment, reduced property value, harm to wildlife, and many
more. Millions of people around the world face increased risk of disease
from toxic waste sites, particularly in low- and middle-income regions
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.greencross.ch/wp-content/uploads/uploads/media/pollution_report_2014_top_ten_wwpp.pdf">3</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-011-9467-9">4</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/impacts-mismanaged-trash">5</a>).</p>
<p>Chemical and product designers have the power to change this trajectory
of hazardous chemical use and waste generation through sustainable new
product development. Using life cycle thinking, considering material
sourcing, health and safety exposures, end-of-life possibilities, and
eliminating toxic chemicals, you can design more economical, more
sustainable, more desirable products. You can use existing design tools
and efficiency metrics in concert to create products that are safe from
their beginnings as raw materials to the end of their useful life and
back into new materials. This can be done with design principles for
sustainable green chemistry and engineering as a consistent backdrop.</p>
<p>The impacts of a product over the course of its lifetime are incredibly
complex. While a product might excel in one aspect of the life cycle, it
may create negative impacts in another. The tradeoffs we make throughout
the design process are often nuanced and complicated. This makes it
challenging to effectively compare the sustainability of different
products that all have different strengths and weaknesses. It also
underscores the importance of clearly articulating the boundaries you
are able ot address in your design process. But it is possible to
increase one’s awareness of the impacts and to make more informed
decisions in product design and development. Product design is not a
static activity, design decisions made early in the process may be
revisited at later stages to continue to drive innovation and continual
improvement.</p>
<p>To compare chemicals, materials and products for Product Assessment,
Safety, and Sustainability (PASS) principles requires that one defines
the life cycle stages, identifies all of the the chemicals used and
produced and identifies the main impacts and exposures on stakeholders
at each life cycle stage.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Using PrISM</a><a class="headerlink" href="#using-prism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PrISM walks chemical and product designers through a series of modules,
applying life cycle thinking and alternative assessment concepts to
allow the user to make informed decisions about their design. PrISM
builds on alternatives assessment in combination with Design Principles
to empower designers to make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>PrISM is applicable for designers at all levels who are interested in
applying a holistic framework: * Product designers * Chemical
designers * Entrepreneurs * Someone with their first great product
idea * Students of chemistry, designer, and related disciplines</p>
<p>PrISM should be used early in the design process, before significant
time and resources have been invested. And then it should be used again
and again as the design evolves. In some cases, the user will complete
step 7 and then cycle through PrISM again with new ideas. In other
cases, the user will move forward with product or chemical design before
returning to PrISM. Early use of PrISM encourages innovative and
disruptive design changes that often discounted later in the process due
to the resources already invested in the existing design. Iterative
application of PrISM helps product and chemical designers continuously
improve the design.</p>

<p>The concepts and methods described in this workbook stem from
established design principles and tools. Designing products that embody
sustainable design principles helps to ensure that products are
sustainable and safe. While these design principles do not translate
directly into metrics, they do provide a directional compass for the
criteria, tools and metrics that allow for measurement. PrISM is founded
on Product Assessment, Safety, and Sustainability (PASS) principles,
which provide a vision that any sustainable product: * Supports a
circular economy * Creates life-friendly chemistry * Restores natural
capital * Supports a just and inclusive society</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id1">
<img alt="PASS Principles" src="_images/NGCPASSPrinciples_FullSize.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">PASS Principles</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>PASS principles are founded on existing designed principles, including
The American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute’s Sustainable
Design Principles which are derived from the Principles of Green
Chemistry and Engineering
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/greenchemistry/resources/2015-gci-design-principles.pdf">6a</a>),
and the OECD’s Broad Policy Principles for Sustainable Materials
Management (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.oecd.org/env/waste/46111789.pdf">6b</a>). PASS
principles were developed in collaboration with Interface.</p>
<p><strong>Supports a circular economy.</strong> This is a broad and overarching
principle that applies to the design of sustainable chemicals materials
and products. A chemical, material or product is not sustainable
inherently. Rather, sustainability is tied to the dynamic context in
which materials flow in environmental and economic systems.</p>
<p>The circular economy concept is simple but difficult to implement. In a
linear economy, as chemicals, materials, and products move through their
life cycle stages and come to the end of life, they are disposed of as
waste. In a circular economy, instead of disposing of products as waste,
they become raw material for new iterations of products. To do so
requires innovative ways of making products from which materials can be
recovered and reused, or the molecular design of chemicals and materials
that degrade completely and harmlessly.</p>
<p>A big challenge to a circular economy is the presence of toxic and
persistent chemicals in products. Toxic and persistent chemicals in
products can spoil opportunities for reuse, recycling and other aspects
of a healthy circular economy. Products that support a circular economy
avoid hazardous components and include plans for maximizing value
recovery at end of life.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="_images/ProductLifeCycle_FullSize.png" /> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.circulardesignguide.com/">Learn more about Circular
Design</a></p>
<p><strong>Creates life-friendly chemistry.</strong> Life-friendly chemistry is
compatible with life and inherently low hazard. Risk is a function of
hazard and exposure. Reducing the inherent hazards of chemicals can help
to reduce risk from chemicals, materials and products. Hazards may also
be physical. For example, litter is a form of unmanaged waste that can
cause physical entrapment and may be mistaken as food by wildlife when
it leaks into the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Restores natural capital.</strong> Resource efficiency is not just about
being efficient and doing more with less. It also includes the
imperative to preserve natural capital. Resources that are renewable
should not be used faster than they can be regenerated. And resources
that are depleting, should not be dissipated and lost to recovery, reuse
and recycling. Waste is a sign of inefficiency in a system.</p>
<p><strong>Supports a just and inclusive society.</strong> Historically underserved
populations are more frequently exposed to environmental hazards and
chemicals of concern than those in affluent communities. This
contributes to disproportionate health impacts, higher healthcare costs,
and a continuing cycle of needless barriers to the best quality of life.
This ultimately hinders the diversity of professionals in the field,
limiting our collective perspective and ability to solve problems.
Sustainable design improvements require that the negative impacts of
products are not merely shifted from one population to another.</p>
<p>A number of useful tools already exist to measure various aspects of
sustainability. These will help you quantify how products fulfill the
vision set forth by these design principles. They include life cycle
assessment (LCA), chemical hazard assessment (CHA), exposure assessment
(EA), and others. Information about these tools is linked to throughout
this workbook.</p>
<p>However, each of these tools only evaluates one sustainability
attribute. In reality sustainability attributes are heavily
interrelated. Improvement in one area may result in changes in
performance in another.</p>
<p>For example, a material such as a plastic may be made only from
chemicals with low inherent hazard. If it ends up in a product that is
likely to end up as litter and degrades into microplastics, then it is
not sustainable. Likewise, extremely toxic chemicals can be made from
rapidly renewable feedstock and very efficient processes.</p>
<p>PrISM uses the tools and methods of alternatives assessment and adapts
them for use in product design and development. “The objective of an
alternatives assessment is to replace chemicals of concern in products
or processes with inherently safer alternatives, thereby protecting and
enhancing human health and the environment”
(<a class="reference external" href="http://theic2.org/article/download-pdf/file_name/IC2_AA_Guide_Version_1.1.pdf">8</a>).
Inherently safer alternatives may be alternative chemicals, materials,
or very different product designs that provide the same product service.
Step 6 - Whole Product Assessment - includes examples of disruptive
innovations versus safer substitutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alternatives-assessment">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Alternatives Assessment</a><a class="headerlink" href="#alternatives-assessment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Alternatives assessment (AA) is a structured method to evaluate
alternatives to chemicals of concern in products and processes.
Alternatives may include chemical substitutes, alternative materials or
product and business model designs that eliminate the need for the
chemical of concern altogether.</p>
<p>AA helps to ensure that designers make changes with their eyes wide
open. The intent is to avoid negative ‘unintended consequences’. That
is, to make sure that one does not move away from a chemical of concern
in a product to an alternative that is unknown or potentially more
problematic from the health and sustainability perspective. AA supports
informed decision making. A number of AA guides are listed below. They
provide resources for assessing alternatives for chemical hazard,
exposure, economic impacts, performance, life cycle impacts, materials
management, social impacts and more.</p>
<p>The tools and decision frameworks in AA can also support product design.
Product assessment and product design are closely related. In the design
process, the designer considers his or her options for chemicals,
materials, business models, manufacturing options and more. Each of
these options can be evaluated from a holistic perspective to inform
decisions along the way. That is why this workbook builds on
alternatives assessment in combination with PASS Principles to empower
designers to make more informed decisions. Alternatives assessment, like
all assessment tools is limited by the availability of good data.
Despite that drawback, approaching design from a life cycle perspective
and using the tools of alternatives assessment to assess various options
can help stimulate ideas for product innovation.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Introduction to Life Cycle Stages</a><a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-life-cycle-stages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every chemical, material and product has a different life cycle.
Depending on the supply chain associated with a chemical, material or
product, it may be necessary to separate out production and
manufacturing into multiple stages.</p>
<p>As you work through PrISM, think through each step of the supply chain
and the individual ‘unit processes’ that bring the product from
conception to production and manufacture to delivery to the user to the
end of its useful life and hopefully into future materials and products.
Where possible, map out the life cycle stages. This information will
also support better understanding of the chemical ingredients used
throughout the life cycle and potential stakeholder impacts including
exposures.</p>
<p>Consider including some (screening) or all (advanced) of the unit
processes in the life cycle stages as illustrated in the graphic below
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.subsport.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Lithner_chemicals_in_plastic.pdf">9</a>).
The life cycle of an ideal product is circular.</p>
