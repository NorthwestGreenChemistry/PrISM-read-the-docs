<p>This module will cover hazard assessment options. You can choose from a
screening-level (option 1), intermediate (option 2) or advanced-level
assessment (option 3); we also provide guidance at the end for a tiered
approach that combines these levels. Information and resources about
creating a chemical inventory are available in the Chemical Inventory
Resource.</p>
<p>A number of chemical hazard assessment tools exist. Most are based
heavily on the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and
Labelling (GHS) and on authoritative and screening lists of chemical
hazards. GHS provides detailed guidance for how to evaluate a broad set
of human health, environmental and physical property hazards. GHS does
not currently provide classification criteria for persistence (P),
bioaccumulation potential (B) and endocrine disruption (EDC) and
therefore criteria for these endpoints are supplemented in other
schemes. An even more comprehensive set of hazard endpoints is provided
by the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) in the US in
support of their safer products program.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev07/English/ST_SG_AC10_30_Rev7e.pdf">Learn more about
GHS.</a></p>
<p>Foundational work on hazard assessment by McDonough Braungart Design
Chemistry and the US Environmental Protection Agency Design for the
Environment (DfE) Program as part of their alternatives assessment
program helped to establish CHA with tabular hazard classification
reporting. The GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals (GS) builds on the GHS,
C2C DfE AA Criteria and provides an additional overall chemical
benchmark score.</p>
<p>The approaches that follow differ by the number of hazard endpoints
evaluated and the depth to which each endpoint is assessed. With
increased depth of chemical assessment comes increased understanding of
the human health and the environment hazards associated with a chemical
and deeper knowledge of data gaps. However, increased depth of
assessment requires greater expertise and cost.</p>

<p>Hazard is something that can potentially cause harm. A shark is an
example of something hazardous. Risk is a function of hazard and
exposure. Swimming in shark-infested waters is combining hazard - sharks
- and exposure to make a very risky activity. <img alt="Hazard versus Risk" src="_images/hazard-v-risk.png" /> Image

Project</a></p>
<p>Green Chemistry is based on the premise that risk is a function of
hazard and exposure. Once can control risk by controlling exposure or by
controlling hazard. Exposure controls are expensive, and can and do
fail. It is better to design, make and use chemicals with low inherent
hazard. And to avoid swimming in shark infested waters.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Classify Hazards for Individual Chemicals</a><a class="headerlink" href="#classify-hazards-for-individual-chemicals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each chemical is evaluated against criteria for individual hazard
endpoints. For example, GHS uses numbered categories to designate hazard
with Category 1 hazards being the most severe. Most of the other
chemical hazard assessment methods use GHS as their base but but then
provide more intuitive or descriptive ways of packaging the results. For
example, a chemical that is a Category 1 Carcinogen would be ‘red’ in a
stoplight communication system such as Cradle to Cradle. It would be
High in the US EPA Design for the Environment Criteria for Alternatives
Assessment and the GreenScreen that uses a system of Hi./Medium/Low,
etc. to designate hazard levels. Hazard classifications can also be
linked to the presence of chemicals on hazard lists and to GHS hazard
phrases.</p>
<p>For example, a chemical that is listed as a Known Carcinogen according
to the US National Institutes of Health would also be High or Red for
Carcinogenicity in GS or C2C. The GHS system links Category levels to
hazard (H) phrases. For example, a chemical that is a Category 2
Carcinogen is suspected of causing cancer would be labeled H351. And a
chemical that is a H400 is very toxic to aquatic life and is Category 1
for Aquatic Toxicity. The hazard phrases associated with a chemical
provide a convenient communication method. These hazard phrases can also
be integrated into automated list searching schemes and accompanying
software.</p>

<p>CHA methods provide insight into the hazards of individual chemicals.
But those chemicals and hazards must also be considered in a mixture.
Some hazards become diluted out and reduced in a mixture. For example, a
strong acid may be very corrosive to the skin and eyes. But when diluted
in a formula, it may end up as only slightly acidic and therefore not
harmful. Think about vinegar or phosphoric acid in popular carbonated
soft drinks.</p>
<p>Other hazards are treated in a more precautionary way because it is very
difficult to prove that there is any safe level. For example, chemicals
known to cause cancer or elements such as lead are not desirable,
especially where there is any feasible opportunity for exposure. In
those cases, their presence in the mixture should lead to assuming that
the mixture carries the same hazards as the individual chemicals. Based
on the CHA method selected and subsequent results, users of the
information may choose different strategies to discriminate between
product mixtures.</p>
<p>GHS provide a decision logic classifying the hazards of mixtures
sometimes referred to as ‘mixture rules’. Classification may come from
measuring the hazards of the mixture such as measuring the pH of a
solution. Or they may be based on the hazard of individual chemicals as
described for Carcinogenicity above and illustrated in the image below.</p>
<p><img alt="GHS mixture classification guidance for carcinogenicity. It considers the quantity of the chemical in the final mixture and rating of the carcinogenic rating of the chemical, as well as whether the mixture has been tested." src="_images/decision-logic-for-mixtures.png" /> (Above) GHS Mixture Classification Guidance for
Carcinogenicity</p>

<p>A product designer may choose to customize an approach to compare
mixtures or polymeric materials based on hazards associated with each
substance in the product. For example, they may choose to calculate the
% composition of each substance in the plastic and whether or not it is
a substance of very high concern (SVHC) or a GS Benchmark 1 chemical.</p>
<p>Alternatively they may choose to compare plastics based on the presence
of chemicals with specific hazards that are relevant to the product
design and how it will be used. For example, skin sensitizing chemicals
would not qualify as GreenScreen Benchmark 1 but they may be undesirable
for plastics used in wearable devices. Example customized criteria for
mixtures and polymeric materials like plastics may include but are not
limited to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Products that contain no substances identified as Substances of Very
High Concern (SVHCs) or scored as GS Benchmark 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Products with the lowest weight percent of SVHC or Benchmark 1
substances.</p></li>
<li><p>Products with no substances with hazard traits that are problematic
based on how the product is used. For example, a chemical could be a
skin sensitizer or highly toxic to aquatic life and not be a SVHC or
Benchmark 1 chemical. Yet if skin sensitizing chemicals were used in
a product that is applied to the skin or if aquatically toxic
chemicals are in a product that is used liberally around boats, then
those chemicals would be prioritized for substitution.</p></li>
<li><p>Products that do not contain SVH./Benchmark 1 chemicals AND that do
not contain chemicals that have specific hazard traits such as skin
sensitizers or aquatic toxicants that would negatively impact a
product from a life cycle perspective.</p></li>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Hazard Assessment Option 1: Hazard List Screening</a><a class="headerlink" href="#hazard-assessment-option-1-hazard-list-screening" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Screening of chemicals against regulatory and authoritative lists of
chemicals with known or suspected hazards can be useful as a first pass
and take little time and expertise. For example, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenscreenchemicals.org/learn/greenscreen-list-translator">GS List
Translator</a>
links hazard lists specified in the GreenScreen method to hazard
assessment classifications. Several software tools have been created to
facilitate structured list screening such as the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pharosproject.net/">Pharos Chemical and
Material Library</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://toxnot.com/">toxnot.com</a>. Some industry sectors such as
textile manufacturing and retail have established restricted substance
lists (RSLs) for materials and manufacturing processes (MRSLs).
Additional screening may be needed for chemicals on RSLs or MRSL.</p>
<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency Safer Choice Program has created
a list of inherently lower hazard chemicals for use primarily in
cleaning products. This list is called the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/safer-ingredients">Safer Chemical Ingredient
List (SCIL)</a>. There
is also a subscription-based online platform called
<a class="reference external" href="http://cleangredients.org/">CleanGredients</a> that identifies

<p>Full chemical hazard assessments require expert review and
interpretation of the scientific literature and results from standard
test methods. When data are lacking for the compound of interest,
predictive models can also be used. In addition, expert chemists and
toxicologists can use a method called ‘read-across’. Read-across is a
structured method for using available data from a data-rich substance to
predict the characteristics of a data-poor substance as long as the
substances are similar enough in structure that they can be considered
surrogates for each other. Read-across may only be appropriate for a
limited set of characteristics.</p>
<p>Computer modeling based on mechanisms of action and structure activity
relationships have improved in recent years with the implementation of
the REACH program in the European Union which de-emphasizes animal
testing. Emerging hazard screening protocols include high throughput
screening such as the Tox 21 program at US EPA. In some cases, such as
with high throughput screening, the science not yet used for regulatory
applications. Here is a list of hazard endpoints typically assessed in a
comprehensive CHA:</p>
<p><img alt="Endpoints include carcinogenicity, genotoxici./mutagenicity, reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, endocrine activity/disruption, acute mammalian toxicity, specific target organ toxicity - single and repeat dose, neurotoxicity, skin sensitization, respiratory sensitization, eye irritation/corrosion, dermal irritation/corrosion, acute aquatic toxicity, chronic aquatic toxicity, persistence, bioaccumulation, flammability, and explosivity/reactivity.

<p>Ideally, comprehensive CHA reports would be readily available for every
chemical; however, that is rarely the case. A pragmatic approach would
entail looking first for existing publicly available comprehensive CHAs
such as those in the <a class="reference external" href="http:/www.theic2.org/hazard-assessment">Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse (IC2) chemical
hazard database</a>. The next
step could be list screening. Chemicals with known hazards listed by
authoritative bodies can be quickly identified using list-screening
tools. Chemicals not on regulatory or hazard lists may be inherently
safer or may be less well-studied. In those instances, an intermediate
chemical hazard assessment may be informative. If results from
intermediate CHA are not definitive, a full CHA may be needed. A full
CHA provides information not only on what hazards are known, but also on
what is not and includes a data gap analysis.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

<p>It is possible that the chemical hazard assessment (either intermediate
or comprehensive) will identify data gaps - hazard endpoints for which
there simply is insuffucient data available for classification. In these
cases, modeling or experiments may be necessary to understand the

<p>Several certification programs exist that evaluate materials for hazard
and either score them or subject them to pa./fail criteria. Each program
uses different concentration thresholds for reporting and scoring that
may be more or less protective and precautionary. Examples include:</p>
<p><strong>Cradle to Cradle (C2C) Certification:</strong> Products are certified from
high to low as platinum, gold, silver, bronze or basic. Each product is
evaluated for Material Health based on their toxicity and feasible
exposure. The C2C method evaluates products in five categories,
i.e. Material Health, Material Reutilization, Renewable Energy &amp; Carbon
Management, Water Stewardship and Social Fairness. However, the Material
Health category can be used as a standalone method. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.c2ccertified.org/get-certified/product-certification">Learn more about

<p><strong>The DfE Safer Choice Program:</strong> The US EPA provides guidance to
evaluate chemicals and their degradation products for potential impacts
on human health and the environment as part of EPA’s Safer Choice
Program. A product that contains ingredients that pass all requirements
qualifies for the Safer Choice label. The program was rebranded from
Design for the Environment (DfE) to Safer Choice; some resources may
still refer to it as DfE. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-01/documents/aa_criteria_v2.pdf">Learn more about the EPA Design for the

<p><strong>GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals</strong> v1.4 was recently updated with a
mixture assessment procedure. The new procedure assesses the hazard of
all ingredients and provides a process to generate an overall mixture
Benchmark score. Benchmark scores for mixtures are distinguished from
Benchmark scores for individual chemicals. Much of this procedure is
based on GHS mixture rules. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenscreenchemicals.org/static/ee_images/uploads/resources/GreenScreenv1-2_Guidance_Assessment_Procedure_FINAL_2013_9_18.pdf">Learn more about the updated GreenScreen

<p><strong>The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling</strong> (GHS)
provides rules for classifying chemical mixtures using a combination of
concentration thresholds and hazard types. Test data for the mixture may
be used. Alternatively, individual ingredients may be classified for
hazard and an algorithm used to calculate an overall hazard
classification. As noted previously, one limitation of GHS is that it
does not include classification criteria for endocrine disruption,
persistence and bioaccumulation that is needed to identify some SVHCs.

clamshell food takeout containers using alternatives assessment:
polypropylene with talc, polystyrene, poly lactic acid (PLA) and waste
fiber. The students researched the identities of likely additives and
residuals based on literature reviews and discussion with polymer
chemists. They obtained information from the manufacturers of the PLA
and waste fiber products on the presence (or absence) of additives. The
students decided to evaluate the polymeric material at the use stage
including residual monomers and any performance additives. They also
considered potential combustion products produced at the end of life
stage based on the likelihood that in Spokane, the containers would be
incinerated.</p>
<p>The table below, taken from the full report, shows how a chemical
inventory revealed a number of additives in the four take-out
