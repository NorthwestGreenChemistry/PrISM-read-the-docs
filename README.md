# README

Original text content in [markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) format was copied from the [Prism app content](https://github.com/NorthwestGreenChemistry/PrISM/tree/develop/app/content) repository develop branch. Images came from [PrISM app assets](https://github.com/NorthwestGreenChemistry/PrISM/tree/develop/app/assets) repository develop branch.

The original electron app was developed with the intent of publishing this content inside the app. The app worked great, however required an annual fee for authentication and required end users to install a special app on their computers, which may have been a deterrent to widespread adoption.

This repository contains the tutorial content liberated from the app.

The content can be read on `prism.readthedocs.io` [:link:](https://nwgc-prism.readthedocs.io/)


## Develop

Discussion about the document conversion process can be read in the [Colophon](https://prism.readthedocs.io/Colophon.html).
