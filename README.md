# PrISM-read-the-docs
> Tutorial content liberated from the PrISM questionaire app 

Original text content in [markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) format was copied from the [Prism app content](https://github.com/NorthwestGreenChemistry/PrISM/tree/develop/app/content) repository develop branch. Images came from [PrISM app assets](https://github.com/NorthwestGreenChemistry/PrISM/tree/develop/app/assets) repository develop branch.

The original [electron app](https://electronjs.org/) was developed with the intent of publishing tutorial content inside the app. The app worked great, however required an annual fee for authentication and required end users to install a special app on their computers, which may have been a deterrent to widespread adoption.

This repository contains the tutorial content liberated from the app.

The content can be read on:

* develop branch: `nwgc-prism.readthedocs.io` [:link:](https://nwgc-prism.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html)
* latest (master branch): `nwgc-prism.readthedocs.io` [:link:](https://nwgc-prism.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Develop

Discussion about the document conversion process can be read in the [Colophon](https://nwgc-prism.readthedocs.io/en/develop/Colophon.html) on the read-the-docs develop branch.
